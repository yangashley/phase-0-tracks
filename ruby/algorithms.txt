    - If no one is exiting, walk forward into elevator until 2 feet from back wall
    - If others are exiting, wait 3 seconds, then walk forward into elevator until 2 feet from back wall
    - If doors shut before you enter, start process over by pressing button to call the elevator
        - When doors open, wait 2 seconds and then walk forward into elevator until 2 feet from back wall
- Turn 90 degrees to the left and walk forward until 1 foot away from adjacent wall
    - Repeat 1 time
- Access user input to determine which floor to go to
- Access grid map of buttons
- Match user input of floor level to the right button with the grid map of the buttons
- Press appropriate button to go to that floor
- Exit when the pressed button lights up and doors open
    - Turn left walk forward 1 foot.
