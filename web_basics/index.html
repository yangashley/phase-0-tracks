	<h1>Welcome. I think you'll enjoy learning all about a fat house cat named Whiskey.</h1>
		<p>Whiskey Ginger is a three year old house cat that I live with. She belongs to my roommate. Whiskey is <strong>incredibly</strong> fluffy and <strong>very</strong> clumsy. She also has <a href="http://pets.webmd.com/cats/feline-herpes-symptoms-treatment">feline herpes</a> which has caused upper respiratory issues for her. Whiskey can often be heard wheezing and sneezing from <em>any corner of the house</em>.</p>

		<h2>Some of Whiskey's favorite activities are:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Sleeping on pillows</li>
				<li>Looking out the window</li>
				<li>Scratching her scratch post</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Whiskey's morning routine:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Stretching</li>
					<li>Meowing until you wake up</li>
					<li>Tearing through the house like a maniac</li>
				</ol>
